Overview:
   The complete ADS1256 application circuit module.
   Onboard Boost boost circuit, 3.3V LDO and 5.0V LDO, can be externally powered from a single supply.
   The power supply and digital level range: 1.8V - 5.5V (default 3.3V).
   Onboard low temperature ticket reference.
   Single-ended or differential inputs can be used. Input attenuation can be configured. By default, there is no attenuation (partial pressure resistance air welding).
   The onboard crystal frequency is 7.680MHz.
   The analog signal input interface connector is MX3.0-16Pin.
   Four-layer FR4 PCB board that complies with ROHS.
   
Note:
1. The onboard default is 3.3V digital power supply for the ADS1256. When connecting to a 1.8V controller, it is necessary to disconnect R24 and supply “3.3V OUT” and “VIN” at the same time (1.8V). (please refer to the schematic diagram or schematic for the principle of setup)
2. The allowable VIN voltage range is: 1.8V-5.5V DC.
