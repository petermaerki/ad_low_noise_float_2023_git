Ferrite reduces noise: example: 2V at input, gain 2. When ferrites are attached the noise level drops.
When the ferrite cores are mounted, the noise level decreases. Most likely, the ferrites absorb high-frequency energy. Without ferrites, the enclosure together with the standoffs and the circuit board may enter into resonance.
